                                        To analyze the number, movement, and even breathing and heartbeat of people in the house, with the capacity of travelling through walls of commonly used Wi-Fi signals (or universal communication signals, frequency between 2.4GHz and 24GHz), and the changes in parameter model. We propose to build a sensing system to detect the situation of people on the other side of the wall. We continue the research on how to reduce error and improve accuracy using interference management techniques. Moreover, we are interested in how to use the wireless signal to achieve through the wall perspective and imaging and other high-precision perception.

                                        We exploit the possibility to sense the real world using electromagnetic, optical, acoustic, etc., signals using Hidden Channel Analysis on multi-source information fusion. On one hand, we take full advantage of the association of collected sensing information with its temporal, spatial and network features and the advanced data mining techniques, to improve the sensing efficiency. On the other hand, we develop customized signal filtering and noise processing algorithms to effectively extract useful signal features and reduce the influence of noise. Further, based on the sensing data and feature analysis, we are of concern to build a feedback circuit for cyber-physics systems and lay the solid foundation for the Internet-of-Things applications.

With a number of problems, such as easiness of data copy, difficulty in pricing, complexity in sales channels management, and the user specific requirement for data security and transaction platform management, we do research on following issues: data transaction model, data safety certification, source marking, quality assessment and pricing, auction protocol and traceability of data.

                                        Under the background of big data and cloud computing, data center is an important back-end support of large-scale computing, mobile computing and other important services. Traditional resource management solutions can no longer meet the needs of current service providers, users and data center systems. By studying the latest development concept of data center (such as Coflow, Edge Computing, wireless data center) , we design a new resource allocation and scheduling scheme to optimize the user experience (such as reduce task completion time) and improve data center system performance (such as reduce the compute nodes energy consumption and load balancing).
